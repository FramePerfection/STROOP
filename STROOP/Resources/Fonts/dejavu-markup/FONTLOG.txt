DejaVu Markup 1.00
Based on: DejaVu Sans Mono 2.35 Copyright (c) 2004-2015 DejaVu fonts team
------------------------------------------------

DejaVu Markup is a slightly modified version of DejaVu Sans Mono with minor
changes to improve the distinction between various similar-looking glyphs.

DejaVu Sans Mono already distinguishes between many similar similar-looking
characters, such as between zero 0 and the capital O, for example.
A text-document markup language (such as LaTeX, AsciiDoc, or markdown)
has additional requirements, especially when marking up classical documents.
The ability to distinguish between the various
kinds of quote marks and dashes becomes important.  Most mono-spaced fonts
do not clearly distinguish between each of these look-alike characters:
a•b a·b a-b a–b a—b ±−4 x⨯X “"″” lI1| O0 {()}
